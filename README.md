# optimize-with-horiseon
semantic re-factoring of a website

This project re-factors the client's existing website for search engine optimization (SEO), namely (1) replacing standard HTML tags with semantic tags and (2) adding alt descriptions to images. A broken nav link was also fixed.

Semantic refactoring aims to make the tags and classes in code more reflective of the content and specifically, the context in which that content appears on the page. Therefore, search engines understand which content is central or peripheral, etc. In addition, alt descriptions of images have two benefits, (1) being more accessible to the blind and visually impaired, and (2) being more accessible to search engines.

As this was my first project, I relied on course materials including class exercises in HTML and CSS, class instruction from my instructor John Young and TA Nick Gambino, and publicly available resources (Stack Exchange, Semrush, w3 schools), and discussion with classmates on Discord.

The user requested semantic HTML elements, logical structure to the source code, accessible alt attributes, sequential heading attributes, and a concise, descriptive title (which I provided as "Optimize with HoriSEOn").
