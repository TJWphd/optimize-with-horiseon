# optimize-with-horiseon

semantic re-factoring of a website
//todo: add README usage instructions, installation steps, and screenshots.

This project re-factors the client's existing website for search engine optimization (SEO),
namely (1) replacing standard HTML tags with semantic tags and (2) adding alt descriptions
to images. A broken nav link was also fixed.

Semantic refactoring aims to make the tags and classes in code more reflective of the content
and specifically, the context in which that content appears on the page. Therefore, search
engines understand which content is central or peripheral, etc. Some examples of the links I
changed are: ..... here is how users can interact with this....

In addition, the alt descriptions of images I added have two benefits: (1) being more
accessible to the blind and visually impaired, and (2) being more accessible to search
engines.

Screenshots from before and after are located in ./assets ....
