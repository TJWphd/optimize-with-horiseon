# optimize-with-horiseon

## description

This project re-factors the client's existing website for search engine optimization (SEO), namely (1) replacing standard HTML tags with semantic tags and (2) adding alt descriptions to images. A broken nav link was also fixed.

Semantic refactoring aims to make the tags and classes in code more reflective of the content
and specifically, the context in which that content appears on the page. This leads to better placement and interaction with search engines, and also improves accessibility for blind/visually impaired users and others.

HTML tags that do not carry semantic meaning (e.g. <div>) are replaced where appropriate with tags that indicate the meaning of the page division (e.g. <main> vs. <aside>) and its visual positioning (e.g. <header>, <footer>).

Additionally, images are given <alt> tags with a verbal description; like the other semantic tags, these verbal descriptions are more accessible to search engines and to users who cannot see pictures, owing either to visual impairment or to technical problems accessing images.

Visually, little has changed in the before and after, other than my (TJW) credit at the bottom of the page. The CSS classes were not changed in this refactor.
