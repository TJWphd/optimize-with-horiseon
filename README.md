# optimize-with-horiseon
semantic re-factoring of a website

For this project I refactored existing code to make the HTML semantic, to fix a broken link, to adjust the page (primarily, the header) to approximate a mock-up provided by the user. This required a number of changes to the HTML and CSS files.

As this was my first project, I relied on course materials including class exercises in HTML and CSS, class instruction from my instructor John Young and TA Nick Gambino, and publicly available resources (Stack Exchange, Semrush, w3 schools), plus a small amount of discussion with classmates around the topics (though we did not share code).

The user requested semantic HTML elements, logical structure to the source code, accessible alt attributes, sequential heading attributes, and a concise, descriptive title (which I provided as "Optimize with HoriSEOn").

The mock-up showed that the nav links on the header should be in-line with the company name, which was the hardest part of this project for me. I did a considerable amount of trial-and-error in VS Code, aided by the "Prettier" plug-in, often looking at option lists and changing one element at a time.

I also used online forums like Stack Exchange to find others' solutions to similar problems, e.g. changing the size of the nav links on the header using <small>.

Probably the easiest part was replacing <div> tags with semantic tags, there is a popular graphic from Semrush that made this incredibly simple.

I was tipped off by a classmate (Arman Tork) that one of the nav links was broken, so that was the first fix I made. Otherwise, my classmates and I mostly gave each other moral support.
